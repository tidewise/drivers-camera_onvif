onvif_camera
=============
Package to read and set parameters to the IP camera compatible with ONVIF-S.

This package uses gSOAP, which is a code generator from SOAP definition files
to C++ client files. The generated files are included in this package, to avoid
having to run the code generation each time (since the definition files are
static, we should have to regen only every so often).

To refresh the code generation, run **from the root of the package**

~~~
./scripts/onvif-wsdl2h src/onvif/
./scripts/onvif-h2cpp src/onvif/
~~~

For security reasons we set a 10 seconds timeout in connection. So, before any
ONVIF communication with the camera you have to use `setCredentials()` private
function to authenticate the connection and then after 10 seconds we shoud call
the function again to use ONVIF. This is better explained at [this tutorial](https://www.genivia.com/examples/onvif/index.html#Using_WS-Security).

Installation
------------
The easiest way to build and install this package is to use Rock's build system.
See [this page](http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/installation.html)
on how to install Rock.

However, if you feel that it's too heavy for your needs, Rock aims at having
most of its "library" packages (such as this one) to follow best practices. See
[this page](http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/packages/outside_of_rock.html)
for installation instructions outside of Rock.

Rock CMake Macros
-----------------

This package uses a set of CMake helper shipped as the Rock CMake macros.
Documentations is available on [this page](http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/packages/cmake_macros.html).

Rock Standard Layout
--------------------

This directory structure follows some simple rules, to allow for generic build
processes and simplify reuse of this project. Following these rules ensures that
the Rock CMake macros automatically handle the project's build process and
install setup properly.

### Folder Structure

| directory         |       purpose                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------               |
| src/              | Contains all header (*.h/*.hpp) and source files                     |
| build/ *          | The target directory for the build process, temporary content        |
| bindings/         | Language bindings for this package, e.g. put into subfolders such as |
| ruby/             | Ruby language bindings                                               |
| viz/              | Source files for a vizkit plugin / widget related to this library    |
| resources/        | General resources such as images that are needed by the program      |
| configuration/    | Configuration files for running the program                          |
| external/         | When including software that needs a non standard installation process, or one that can be easily embedded include the external software directly here |
| doc/              | should contain the existing doxygen file: doxygen.conf               |
